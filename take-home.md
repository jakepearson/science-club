# Science Club - Programming

Today, at science club, we learned a little about computer programming. We programmed each other with sets of instructions. We then did some programming in `Javascript` on Khan Academy. If you or your child would like to work more with what we did today, you can look at the content of the class here:

Or you can explore these websites:

* https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming
* http://code.org/
* https://scratch.mit.edu/

I'm happy to help if you have any questions (notjakepearson@gmail.com)

Thanks,
Jake
