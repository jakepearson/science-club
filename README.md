# Science Club - Programming

## What is programming? (5 minutes)
* Giving instructions to computers
* Always follow instructions even if they are a bad idea
* Anyone know a programmer? Anyone work on computers?
* Instructions can have arguments (for example, the `walk` instruction will include how many steps to take)
* Syntax for our programs
    * function name
    * left parenthesis
    * some arguments (if there is more than one then there must be a comma between each)
    * right parenthesis
    * semi-colon

```javascript
walk(5);
```

## Program the Teacher (5 minutes)
The instructor will ask kids to take turns giving instructions to an appointed adult to walk to a place in the room and pick up an object off the floor. In the first attempt the adult will act like a person and avoid walls and generally make it easy for the kids to give instructions. For the second attempt, the adult will be instructed to act like a computer. We will do this by blindfolding the “computer”. That might mean walking into a wall, or picking something off the floor that isn’t there.

## Programming the Kids (20 minutes)
Kids will now break up into as many groups as we have helpers for. One kid will be chosen as the computer. The rest will be the programmers who define a set of instructions for the “computer” to follow. The goal will be same as the previous activity except this time the “programmers” will make up the instructions in advance. Each group will have a paper that includes a list of sample instructions: forward, turn left, turn right, grab, etc. Groups will take turns generating a list of instructions for the other kids to follow.

## Programming a Computer (55 minutes)
Kids will go to the library computer lab. Open their browsers to [http://bit.ly/1wpueLk](http://bit.ly/1wpueLk). Kids will then be able to enter programs in `Javascript` on the Khan Academy website to draw shapes and lines on the screen. First, have them copy the code below for the house then the snowman. Emphasize that each line in the program is an instruction like we discussed early. Kids are welcome to modify the code any way they like if there is time. You might have them add windows to the house or snowflakes by the snowman. Or if they like they create something from scratch.
